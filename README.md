# 🥷 Ninja Button

A troll website where buttons look simple... until you try to click them 👀

## 🌀 About

**Ninja Button** is a fun, interactive mini-site designed to mess with users (in the best way). What seems like two ordinary buttons quickly turns into a challenge as they **teleport away** the moment you try to click. Great for laughs, challenges, or just showing off your ninja-level front-end skills 🐱‍👤

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 Buttons are centered nicely on the screen at first.
- 🐱‍🏍 On hover, they instantly **teleport** to a random location on the screen.
- 🔠 The main text "scrambles" when hovered, with a cool hacker-style effect.
- 🌈 Gradient background and animated text for a vivid, modern look.
- 🫣 **Impossible to click** — the buttons won't let you win!

## 🛠 Built With
